                    <p>Migaloo started when it’s founder left the agency recruitment space in 2015.  As he moved on up into hiring positions in the tech space,
                    he leveled his experience to both sides of the recruitment spectrum. This is the point where he knew he’d be heading back to&nbsp;recruitment.</p>

                    <p>After several months of deliberating and meeting with industry experts, he called upon a highschool friend who was teaching computer sciences at 
                    the University of Toronto. He too was thinking of solutions to make recruitment better as he was an expert coming from the third party spectrum 
                    as a passive candidate in a booming Toronto tech job market. He brought on a mutual friend who rounded out our expert technology capabilities and we were&nbsp;off.</p>

                    <p>We are three ambitious friends who met in high school. A couple of us have known each other from playing on the same soccer team since we were 7. 
                    To make things more interesting and also a little more confusing, we all happen to share the same first name, Michael.  So, for the sake of this section, 
                    we'll go by our last/nicknames - Sansone, Cutch, and&nbsp;Nasser.</p>

                    <p>Sansone and Cutch are the brilliant tech brains in our founding team and left high school to attend University of Toronto for computer sciences.  
                    Throughout their University career they were convinced they were going to one day work on a project of mutual intrest. After many projects Sansone 
                    ran into Nasser, who on the other hand, went to University for a commerce degree where he went on to successful in recruitment, finance, and to lead one 
                    of Canada's fastest growing tech&nbsp;startups.</p>

                    <p>After many iterations of company names, we came up with one that depicted something rare. As great candidates are hard to come by in this market.  
                    We looked at everything from rare gems to animals and in our search we came across a white (albino) humpback whale named Migaloo. Funny enough, 
                    it is a name that Sansone and Cutch's family would call them as kids. It started in Italian as "me-ghel-lé" which eventually got to&nbsp;migaloo</p>

                    <p>Migaloo believes recruitment is not broken, but highly inefficient.  Migaloo was created to fix inefficiencies and allow employers to comfortably 
                    benefit from the expertise of third-party&nbsp;recruiters.</p>
